In this project, I displayed all posts with an option to sort them, created a SQL schema with posts and comments tables linked by a foreign key, and added a delete button for posts. I also developed a form for submitting comments and connected them to posts using dynamic routes (e.g., /posts/:postid). Additionally, I implemented a redirect to the posts page after creating a post.

YouTube tutorials helped me with dynamic routing, while Stack Overflow and Reddit were invaluable for troubleshooting deployment issues on Vercel and state management problems in React. I also ran into deployment issues due to ESLint configuration, but after looking up solutions online, I was able to fix it :)
